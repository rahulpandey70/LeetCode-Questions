    Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. 
    For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

    [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
    [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.

    Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
    You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

    Example:-
    Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
    
    Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

    Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
    Output: 11
    Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.
