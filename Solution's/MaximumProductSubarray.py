"""
    Given an integer array nums, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, 
    and return the product.

    It is guaranteed that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
    
    A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

    Example:-
    Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.

    Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
